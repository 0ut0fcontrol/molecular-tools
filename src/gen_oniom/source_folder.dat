gen_oniom is a program to convert snapshots (g96, xyz, pdb...) into G09 input files allowing the definition of ONIOM layers

*WARNING* The program is very ineficient from the point of view of memory management. This can eventually collapse the computer
          even at compilation time. Probably, the subroutine "read_top" (from gro_manage module) is the main weak point.
          This should be fixed before this app is included in the GIT distribution
